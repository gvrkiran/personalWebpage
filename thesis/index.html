	<h2>Abstract:</h2>
	<p>
	This thesis provides a broad overview of polarization on social media,
along with algorithmic techniques to identify polarized topics,
understanding their properties over time, and
finally, to reduce polarization.
	</p>

	<p>
	First, we provide methods to <b>identify polarized topics automatically</b>
from social-media streams.
Our methods are mainly based on interaction networks,
i.e., networks of social media users, connected through certain types of interactions.
We first show that polarized topics have a special bi-clustered structure in their retweet network
and propose an algorithm to quantify the degree of polarization by using a random walk on this network.
We then make use of subgraph patterns (motifs) in the reply network of users to show that we can
easily identify polarized topics using such patterns.
Since our analysis does not use content, our methods are able to generalize to any topic, domain and language.
	</p>

	<p>
	Next, we study the <b>dynamic aspects of the process of polarization</b>.
We understand what happens to the interaction networks defined above in case of
a sudden increase in interest of users on the topic.
We then address the question on whether polarization on Twitter has increased over the last 8 years
and find evidence to support that it does.
	</p>

	<p>
	Finally, given these findings, we <b>design algorithms to reduce polarization</b>. We propose two approaches.
In the first approach, we propose connecting users with opposing viewpoints in order to reduce polarization.
Our method takes into account the users' interests and their current level of polarization
to help them get connected to the people they feel comfortable in doing so.
In the second approach, we take an information-diffusion route. We pose the problem of reducing polarization
as a task of spreading information that reaches both sides of the polarized topic.
	</p>

	<p>
Given the ever-increasing polarization in the society, almost everywhere in the world, and the real-world
impact of polarized discussions (e.g., brexit, trump, etc.), the advances made in this
thesis are necessary, relevant and timely.
	</p>

						Data generated on location-based social networks provide rich information on the whereabouts of urban
						dwellers. Specifically, such data reveal who spends time where, when, and on what type of activity (e.g.,
						shopping at a mall, or dining at a restaurant). That information can, in turn, be used to describe city
						regions in terms of activity that takes place therein. For example, the data might reveal that citizens
						visit one region mainly for shopping in the morning, while another for dining in the evening. Furthermore,
						once such a description is available, one can ask more elaborate questions: What are the features that
						distinguish one region from another -- is it simply the type of venues they host or is it the visitors
						they attract? What regions are similar across cities? 
						</p>
						<p>
						In this paper, we attempt to answer these questions using publicly shared Foursquare data. In contrast
						with previous work, our method makes use of a probabilistic model with minimal assumptions about the data
						and thus relieves us from having to make arbitrary decisions in our analysis (e.g., regarding the
						granularity of discovered regions or the importance of different features). We perform an empirical
						comparison with previous work and discuss insights obtained through our findings.

							We address the problem of classifying the links of signed social networks given their full structural
							topology. Motivated by a binary user behaviour assumption, which is supported by decades of research in
							psychology, we develop an efficient and surprisingly simple approach to solve this classification problem.
							Our methods operate both within the active and batch settings. We demonstrate that the algorithms we
							developed are extremely fast in both theoretical and practical terms. Within the active setting, we
							provide a new complexity measure and a rigorous analysis of our methods that hold for arbitrary signed
							networks. We validate our theoretical claims carrying out a set of experiments on three well known
							real-world datasets, showing that our methods outperform the competitors while being much faster.

							Data generated on location-aware social media provide rich information about the places (shopping malls,
							restaurants, cafés, etc) where citizens spend their time.  That information can, in turn, be used to
							describe city neighborhoods in terms of the activity that takes place therein. For example, the data might
							reveal that citizens visit one neighborhood mainly for shopping, while another for its dining venues.  In
							this paper, we present a methodology to analyze such data, describe neighborhoods in terms of the activity
							they host, and discover similar neighborhoods across cities.  Our methods help understand how citizens
							experience their cities and have applications in recommending city locations to visit.
							</p>
							<p>
							Using data collected from Foursquare and Flickr, that include millions of activity items from 20 cities in
							Europe and the US, we conduct an extensive study on features and measures that can be used to quantify
							similarity of city neighborhoods. We find that a custom variant of the earth-mover's distance outperforms
							other candidate measures in finding similar neighborhoods.  Subsequently, using that variant of
							earth-mover's distance as our measure of choice, we address the issue of computational efficiency: given a
							neighborhood in one city, identify efficiently the most similar neighborhood in another city.  We propose
							a similarity-search strategy that yields significant speed improvement over the brute-force search, with
							minimal loss in accuracy. We conclude our paper with a case study in comparing neighborhoods of Paris to
							neighborhoods of other cities and report our findings.

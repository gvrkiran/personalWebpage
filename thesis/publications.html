	<h1>Polarization on Social Media</h1>
	<h2>Abstract:</h2>
	<p>
	This thesis provides a broad overview of polarization on social media,
along with algorithmic techniques to identify polarized topics,
understanding their properties over time, and
finally, to reduce polarization.
	</p>

	<p>
	First, we provide methods to <b>identify polarized topics automatically</b>
from social-media streams.
Our methods are mainly based on interaction networks,
i.e., networks of social media users, connected through certain types of interactions.
We first show that polarized topics have a special bi-clustered structure in their retweet network
and propose an algorithm to quantify the degree of polarization by using a random walk on this network.
We then make use of subgraph patterns (motifs) in the reply network of users to show that we can
easily identify polarized topics using such patterns.
Since our analysis does not use content, our methods are able to generalize to any topic, domain and language.
	</p>

	<p>
	Next, we study the <b>dynamic aspects of the process of polarization</b>.
We understand what happens to the interaction networks defined above in case of
a sudden increase in interest of users on the topic.
We then address the question on whether polarization on Twitter has increased over the last 8 years
and find evidence to support that it does.
	</p>

	<p>
	Finally, given these findings, we <b>design algorithms to reduce polarization</b>. We propose two approaches.
In the first approach, we propose connecting users with opposing viewpoints in order to reduce polarization.
Our method takes into account the users' interests and their current level of polarization
to help them get connected to the people they feel comfortable in doing so.
In the second approach, we take an information-diffusion route. We pose the problem of reducing polarization
as a task of spreading information that reaches both sides of the polarized topic.
	</p>

	<p>
Given the ever-increasing polarization in the society, almost everywhere in the world, and the real-world
impact of polarized discussions (e.g., brexit, trump, etc.), the advances made in this
thesis are necessary, relevant and timely.
	</p>

						Data generated on location-based social networks provide rich information on the whereabouts of urban
						dwellers. Specifically, such data reveal who spends time where, when, and on what type of activity (e.g.,
						shopping at a mall, or dining at a restaurant). That information can, in turn, be used to describe city
						regions in terms of activity that takes place therein. For example, the data might reveal that citizens
						visit one region mainly for shopping in the morning, while another for dining in the evening. Furthermore,
						once such a description is available, one can ask more elaborate questions: What are the features that
						distinguish one region from another -- is it simply the type of venues they host or is it the visitors
						they attract? What regions are similar across cities? 
						</p>
						<p>
						In this paper, we attempt to answer these questions using publicly shared Foursquare data. In contrast
						with previous work, our method makes use of a probabilistic model with minimal assumptions about the data
						and thus relieves us from having to make arbitrary decisions in our analysis (e.g., regarding the
						granularity of discovered regions or the importance of different features). We perform an empirical
						comparison with previous work and discuss insights obtained through our findings.

							We address the problem of classifying the links of signed social networks given their full structural
							topology. Motivated by a binary user behaviour assumption, which is supported by decades of research in
							psychology, we develop an efficient and surprisingly simple approach to solve this classification problem.
							Our methods operate both within the active and batch settings. We demonstrate that the algorithms we
							developed are extremely fast in both theoretical and practical terms. Within the active setting, we
							provide a new complexity measure and a rigorous analysis of our methods that hold for arbitrary signed
							networks. We validate our theoretical claims carrying out a set of experiments on three well known
							real-world datasets, showing that our methods outperform the competitors while being much faster.

							Data generated on location-aware social media provide rich information about the places (shopping malls,

							describe city neighborhoods in terms of the activity that takes place therein. For example, the data might

							</p>
							<p>
							Using data collected from Foursquare and Flickr, that include millions of activity items from 20 cities in
							Europe and the US, we conduct an extensive study on features and measures that can be used to quantify
							similarity of city neighborhoods. We find that a custom variant of the earth-mover's distance outperforms
							other candidate measures in finding similar neighborhoods.  Subsequently, using that variant of
							earth-mover's distance as our measure of choice, we address the issue of computational efficiency: given a
							neighborhood in one city, identify efficiently the most similar neighborhood in another city.  We propose
							a similarity-search strategy that yields significant speed improvement over the brute-force search, with
							minimal loss in accuracy. We conclude our paper with a case study in comparing neighborhoods of Paris to
							neighborhoods of other cities and report our findings.

							</a>
							<p>
							We develop methods to efficiently and accurately characterize edges in complex networks. In simple graphs,
							nodes are connected by a single semantic. For instance, two users are friends in a social networks.
							Moreover, those connections are typically driven by node similarity, according to homophily. In the
							previous example, users become friends because of common features. By contrast, complex networks are
							graphs where every connection has one semantic among k possible ones. Those connections are moreover based
							on both partial homophily and heterophily of their endpoints. This additional information enable finer
							analysis of real world graphs. However, it can be expensive to acquire, or is sometimes not known
							beforehand. We address the problems of inferring edge semantics in various settings. First, we consider
							graphs where edges have two opposite semantics, and where we observe the label of some edges. These
							so-called signed graphs are a common way to represent polarized interactions. We propose two learning
							biases suited for directed and undirected signed graphs respectively. This leads us to design several
							algorithms leveraging the graph topology to solve a binary classification problem that we call edge sign
							prediction. Second, we consider graphs with k > 2 available semantics for edge. In that case of multilayer
							graphs, we are not provided with any edge label, but instead are given one feature vector for each node.
							Faced with such an unsupervised problem, we devise a quality criterion expressing how well an edge
							k-partition and k semantical vectors explains the observed connections. We optimize this goodness of
							explanation criterion in vectorial and matricial forms.

							We propose a method to match similar neighborhoods across different cities.  That is, we give ourselves a
							measure of similarity between urban regions, as well as one region in one city. Our goal is then to find
							the region in some other cities which minimize the distance with the query region. Furthermore, we seek to
							do it efficiently, as it is prohibitive to evaluate the distance of all possible candidate regions.
							</p>
							<p>
							First, we collect trace of activities in 20 European and American cities from location aware social
							platforms Foursquare and Flickr. A thorough exploration of this dataset leads us to describe individual
							venues by relevant features including their aggregate activity across time, their visitors and overall
							popularity, and the typology of their surrounding.  Then we learned several measures of venue similarity
							in a semi-supervised setting and evaluate their performance on two information retrieval tasks.  After
							gathering human ground truth about neighborhoods, we evaluate different metrics between sets of venues and
							find out that Earth Mover's Distance is best suited at assessing neighborhood similarity. Finally, we
							address the computational efficiency problem of finding the most similar neighborhood given a query. We
							devise a heuristic search strategy and show that it provides results of comparable quality while being
							orders of magnitude faster. This work has application in touristic recommendation and urban planning, as
							it provides a similarity measure between urban areas.

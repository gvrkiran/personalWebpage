<li>Mood swings are very common and normal. You can go from "I'm the most intelligent guy on the planet" to "My life sucks, my research is pointless" in a day. I think the earlier you realize this, the better. I feel its part of the PhD experience to go through this roller coaster of emotions.</li>
<li>Its OK to look for competition, but dont be bothered too much by it.</li>
<li>Dont expect a lot of help and dont feel obliged to get help, especially after, say, 1 year into your PhD. By this time, you're expected to learn something.</li>
<li>That being said, dont get stuck and remain stuck. A lot of people (especially your advisor) want to (and will) help you.</li>
<li>There are people who make you look stupid. Learn to ignore them or comfort yourself, because its easy to go down that road and feel pointless.</li>
<li>I've read in a *lot* of places (really, a lot). Dont get carried away by the work. Have a life. its really easy to go this way.. </li>
<li>Feel excited about what you work on. If you are not, take a step back and give it a thought if you are doing the right thing.</li>
<li>Think about what you want to do with your life *before* you start or at least dont leave it to the end. You should have a clear understanding why you want to get a PhD.</li>
<li>A PhD is not about knowing something about everything. It is about knowing everything about something. Try to evaluate yourself during your journey if there any 'something' that you can claim to know everything.</li>
<li>Dont be apologetic for your ignorance. this is the time to be ignorant. ask and learn. you should be ashamed of not learning, and not about asking. (many other gems http://blogs.nature.com/naturejobs/2016/03/30/the-value-of-my-phd-looking-back-1-year-after-graduating)</li>
<li>'You don't have a fixed schedule (no classes after the first year), so you will feel guilty whenever you are not working. Yet when research isn't going well, you'll get demoralized and start procrastinating, which makes you feel more guilty.' I'm so surprised that this experience is so ubiquitous.

<li>Dont aim too high, dont aim too low. Believe in the idea you pursue yourself. For example, my phd thesis was on solving the filter bubble issue in news. its a really important issue, even mentioned by obama (see this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiYXvVWppFM at 5:19)</li>
<li>PhD at most times feels like shouting in the dark. you put in so much effort for weeks and come up with some thing, write up your findings and no one cares or no one seems to appreciate the effort that went into it. deal with it.</li>
<li>There are <b>always</b> people who are either more intelligent or more hard working or if nothing, more lucky than you. Your life will be orders of magnitude better if you can learn to ignore that. "Ultimately, the race is to be the best you possible." http://qz.com/728264/what-does-an-iim-graduate-say-to-his-20-year-younger-self/</li>
<li>Start running or writing or what ever, be good at something else other than your phd.</li>
<li>get out of bad projects soon, if not very early. If you dont learn to recognize the bad projects better as you progress, probably you're doing something wrong</li>
<li>There are definitely things that only time can tell. Be cautious on judging what might be those 'things' and just make the right judgement. e.g. should i sacrifice my career to be close to my family? hint: nothing is more important than family.</li>
<li>You are most likely not going to be working on something related to your phd, almost certainly if you go to the industry. In that case, it might be good to question your motives on spending a large portion of your productive years. Do you value learning more over other worldly things such as salary or position? a very difficult question to answer, but it will definitely help in not feeling regretted if you realize this after 4-5 years of your time.</li>
<li>Try to maximize the number of people you work with and the areas you explore. This is very very easy said than done, but at least being aware of the fact and trying is better, because it will be definitely very easy to stick to your comfort zone and just work only with one person (advisor) and graduate. this especially makes a difference in future academic pursuits</li>
<li>dont be in a position to be ashamed about explaining your work. if you dont like the work you're doing, you're probably doing an extreme dis-service to your time.</li>
<li>Dont be frustrated that you dont have new ideas to tackle (and how it can feel as if everything in science has been solved). The only way to get over it is to read read read and explore the area you are interested in. ideas will flow automatically.</li>
<li>Getting used to working with people who you disagree with is a great learning, and must be an essential part of your phd learning experience. especially in open ended research, people will have different view points and all of the might be right (or wrong). learn to make your case well or agree to disagree. but do not pick fights, out of disagreement. they take you no where. also remember that if the disagreement is with your professor, they are almost probably right, given their vast experience.</li>
<li>Have your own thing. Especially after your first couple of years into your PhD. I mean, even though you should look for collaborations and work on other stuff, have your own topic that you own and feel completely responsible for. Dont expect others to help you with it. This is really important. I really learnt this late in my phd and there were lots of situations where i felt that my collaborators just didnt contribute enough (or at all), but thats the way it should be. Your phd topic is your own, learn to work on it by your own. You should be the expert on it. take help/adivce from others, but dont expect others to do the work for you.</li>
<li>spend time collecting quality data. that investment is never in vain. (might be specific for some types of phd). at least for me, it really helped</li>
<li>if you are from a lesser known university, .... things do matter. Try to create a good first impression, since you will have the burden of (or at least dont have the luxury of the brand).</li>
<li>internships are the best things that can happen in your phd. if you have a chance (i.e. if your Phd funding allows u to), you must must must must do it. Might be a bit challenging to get positions in the US., though there are now great positions in europe too.</li>
<li>something about *when* to do a phd. should you go right after bachelors?</li>
<li>something about choosing a well known school!!!</li>
